Kernel core likhna hai --- Prediction API
JMS-TO-SQL and kernel core set up

ASK:
	Design an api using raw data and metrics.csv
		Kernel core side
		Should be syncronous with the database table
		From raw data, each minute to one day
		Should be scalable
	Request : Pull data for 3 days (say)
		Argument time (3 or 4 days) get from database
		metrics.csv: model name, model version, model location.
	Integrate the data from JMS-TO-SQL with the created API (on kernel core)
